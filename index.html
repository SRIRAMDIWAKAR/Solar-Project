            <p class="text-strat paragraph text-white">The solar system is a group of gravitationally bound celestial objects which have been held together by their gravity and orbit around the Sun, which is a star. These objects include:
                    The Sun: It is the primary source of light and energy.
                    Planets: There are eight major planets in our solar system—Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—and each of them possesses unique characteristics.
                    Dwarf Planets: Objects like Pluto, Eris, and Ceres that are virtually like planets, but do not fit all of the definitions to be labeled as a planet.
                    Moons: Natural satellites revolving around planets. Earth has one moon, while Jupiter has more than 70.
                    Asteroids: Most are found within the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. They are rocky bodies with varying sizes.
                    Comets: Comets are icy bodies that emit gas and dust as they approach the Sun. This creates a glowing coma and tail.
                    Meteoroids: Tiny pieces of rock or metal floating in space, which, if they enter Earth's atmosphere, may become meteors or meteorites when they strike the ground.
                    4.6 billion years ago, the solar system developed from a vast cloud of gas and dust. The solar system's size and richness are sufficient reason to make the very arduous pursuit of astronomy worthwhile.</p>

        <h1 class="text-center text-danger">Pluto</h1>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p class="text-white">Pluto, considered to be the ninth planet by many, is actually more of a dwarf planet. It was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh, who identified it in 1930 as part of our solar system's family of planets until the International Astronomical Union redefined the criteria for what constitutes a planet in 2006.

                ### Key Facts about Pluto:
                
                - **Diameter**: Pluto is estimated to be about two-thirds the size of Earth's moon, with a diameter of approximately 2,377 kilometers (1,477 miles).
                - **Orbit**: It has an elliptical orbit and completes one orbit around the Sun in about 248 Earth years.
                - **Surface**: The surface is made up mainly of nitrogen ice, and some regions on Pluto have methane or carbon monoxide ice. There are mountains, plains, and possible cryovolcanoes.
                - **Atmosphere**: Pluto's atmosphere is very thin and mostly composed of nitrogen. There are traces of methane and carbon monoxide as well. Its atmosphere also changes in size with its orbit around the Sun.
                - **Moons**: Pluto has five known moons. In fact, the largest moon is called Charon, and when it was discovered relative to Pluto's size, its discoverers opted to consider them a double dwarf planet system.
                
                ### Exploration
                
                It was during the fly-by by the New Horizons spacecraft of NASA in July 2015 that high-resolution close-up images and data about this dwarf planet were brought back, which portray its complex geology and its life-giving atmosphere.
                
                Pluto is an object of strong interest to planetary scientists and continues to be a topic of discussion about classification and status in our solar system.</p>

            <h1 class="text-center text-danger">Neptune</h1>
            <p class="text-white">
                Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. It is a gas giant, primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane, which gives it a striking blue color. Here are some key points about Neptune:

                1. **Size and Composition**: Neptune has a diameter of about 49,244 kilometers (30,598 miles), making it the fourth largest planet by diameter. Its atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, with a notable amount of methane, which absorbs red light and reflects blue.
                
                2. **Orbit and Rotation**: Neptune takes about 165 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. Its rotation period is roughly 16 hours.
                
                3. **Moons**: Neptune has 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest. Triton is unique because it orbits Neptune in the opposite direction of the planet’s rotation, suggesting it may have been captured by Neptune’s gravity.
                
                4. **Weather and Winds**: Neptune is known for its dynamic atmosphere, featuring the strongest winds in the solar system, which can reach speeds of up to 2,100 kilometers per hour (1,300 miles per hour). Storms similar to Jupiter’s Great Red Spot have been observed.
                
                5. **Discovery**: Neptune was discovered on September 23, 1846, by astronomers Johann Galle and Heinrich d'Arrest, based on predictions made by mathematicians using gravitational effects observed on Uranus.
                
                6. **Exploration**: The only spacecraft to visit Neptune is NASA's Voyager 2, which flew by the planet in 1989, providing valuable data and images.
                
                Neptune remains a fascinating subject of study due to its unique features and the mysteries still surrounding it!

                <h1 class="text-center text-danger">Uranus</h1>
                <p class="text-white">It is the seventh planet from the Sun, characterized with the blue color and tilt in the universe. The following represent some of the key points regarding Uranus:

                    1. **Diameter, Composition**: In diameter, Uranus is the third largest of planets in the solar system at 50,724 kilometers (31,518 miles). It is an ice giant, constituting hydrogen and helium, but with a higher proportion of "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane.
                    
                    2. **Tilt and Rotation** One of the more ridiculous aspects of Uranus is its axial tilt, almost reaching about 98 degrees. That is like being on the side of rotation. Extremes of seasonal variation are caused because it orbits very close to the Sun. It takes about 84 Earth years to complete one orbit.
                    
                    3. Atmosphere and Weather : The atmosphere is multiplexed with very fast winds and clouds; methane in the atmosphere absorbs red light, which makes it appear bluish.
                    4. Moons and Rings: There are 27 known moons for Uranus and the five biggest of them include Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda. It has a very faint ring system consisting of several narrow rings.
                    
                    5. **Discovery**: Seen by Sir William Herschel on March 13, 1781, Uranus is the first planet ever discovered through a telescope.
                    
                    6. **Exploration**: Up to now, only NASA's Voyager 2 has flown by Uranus in 1986, while providing scientists with the much-needed atmospheric, moon, and ring data.
                    
                    Uranus is indeed a very exciting observation area for astronomers due to its remarkable characteristics and the many mysteries still waiting to be unraveled!</p>

                <h1 class="text-center text-danger">Saturn</h1>
                <p class="text-white">Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and is known for its striking rings. Some essential facts about Saturn:

                    1. **Size and Composition**: Saturn is the second largest planet in all of the solar system, measuring about 116,460 km in diameter, or 72,366 miles. It's much like Jupiter, a gas giant of hydrogen and helium, but it does contain small amounts of heavier elements.
                    
                    2. **Rings**: Saturn possesses a fully developed ring system made of ice and rock particles. The rings contain some only few distinct and very broad bands; at its widest, the ring system stretches across some 280,000 kilometres or 175,000 miles, yet these rings are in some places no thicker than a few dozen metres.
                    
                    3. **Moons**: Saturn has more than 80 known moons, and the largest of all is Titan. Titan is larger than the entire planet Mercury and has a thick atmosphere, making it one of the most interesting objects in our solar system to research.
                    
                    4. **Atmosphere and Weather**: Wind speeds on Saturn can reach a maximum of 1,800 kilometers per hour (1,100 miles per hour). Saturn's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's with banded patterns of storms and swirling clouds.
                    
                    5. **Rotation and Orbit**: The day on Saturn is relatively short at 10.7 hours around its axis. Compared to Earth time, Saturn orbits the Sun in 29.5 Earth years.
                    
                    6. **Exploration**: Saturn has been known since the dawn of ancient times and was written down by early astronomers. Its rings were, in fact, discovered as early as 1610 by Galileo.
                    
                    7. **Exploration**: Many spacecraft have visited Saturn, including Pioneer 11 and Voyager 1 and 2, and the Cassini-Huygens that gathered tons of information between 2004 and 2017. Cassini even sent the Huygens probe to Titan to disclose wonderful information about the moon.
                    
                    This is the reason why Saturn's astounding beauty and complexity attract scientists and astronomers of all ages.</p>

    <p class="text-white">The largest planet in the solar system, Jupiter is characterized by an attractive appearance and mighty features. Some interesting facts about Jupiter are as follows:

        1. **Size and Composition**: Jupiter is a gas giant, mainly composed of hydrogen and helium. It has a diameter of 86,881 miles or 139,822 kilometers and is approximately 11 times spread out than Earth.
        
        2. **The Great Red Spot**: This is the biggest storm on Jupiter, a size larger than Earth and storming at least for 350 years. It is characterized by its reddish color and swirling winds.
        
        3. **Moons**: The number of moons on these planets is very impressive,-79 have been confirmed, but the four largest are known as the Galilean moons. Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede is actually the largest moon in the solar system.
        
        4. **Ring System**: Much less evolved than Saturn's, Jupiter's ring system is primarily dust particles.
        5. **Magnetic Field**: Jupiter possesses the strongest magnetic field in the solar system-an impressive 20,000 times stronger than Earth's. THE.
        
        6. **Exploration**: Several missions into space have made it to Jupiter to explore it, like NASA's Galileo orbiter and the Juno spacecraft that began giving details in 2016 on its atmospheric system, magnetic field, and the structure of the planet.
        
        7. **Weather condition of Atmosphere**: Jupiter's surface has dynamic weather. The phenomenon of high-velocity winds and enormous storms is present. The major bands of clouds are ammonia, methane, and water vapor.
        
        This is one of the reasons Jupiter has always been an object of interest not only to astronomers but also to any interested person who follows space science, with further discoveries and research continuing to probe into the complexity of this atmosphere and possibly hosting life on its moons.</p>

            <h1 class="text-center text-danger">Mars</h1>
            <p class="text-white">Mars is sometimes called the "Red Planet," but what gives it that distinctive reddish color is iron oxide, more commonly known as rust on the planet's surface. Following are key facts about Mars:

                1. **Size and Composition**: Mars is a planet that has about 4,212 miles in diameter, half the size of Earth. It is also a rocky planet with very thin atmosphere dominated by carbon dioxide.
                
                2. **Surface Features**: Mars is characterized by a varied landscape, home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and the huge canyon system Valles Marineris, stretching more than 2,500 miles (4,000 kilometers) long. Ice caps at the poles, formed of ice of water, and carbon dioxide, make up the planet's surface.
                
                3. **Water Flow**: It is suggested that liquid water once flowed on Mars, and there is evidence for ancient riverbeds and lake beds, though now mostly ice. In limited conditions, there are indications for salty liquid flows.
                
                4. **Moons**: There are two very small moons that orbit Mars Phobos and Deimos. Both are irregularly shaped and considered to be captured asteroids.
                
                Exploration: Mars has been explored by many robots like rovers Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance. These missions gave much needed data on the geology, climate of the planet, and its potential for having past life.
                
                6. **Atmosphere and Climate**: The atmosphere on Mars is very thin, and because of this, temperatures often fluctuate greatly; they can reach -195 degrees Fahrenheit (-125 degrees Celsius) in winter at the poles. There are frequent dust storms that cover the entire planet.
                
                7. **Habito Potential**: It remains with a big interest of scientists because its past conditions were very friendly for life probably. Current research is focused on seeking some evidences of the ancient microbial activity here and to understand habitability of the planet.
                
                Mars still serves as the number one candidate for manned exploration. Indeed, a few space agencies are discussing plans for manned missions.</p>

            <h1 class="text-center text-danger">Earth</h1>
            <p class="text-white">Earth, the third planet from the Sun, is the only known planet to have supported life. Here are some facts about Earth:

                1. Size and Composition: Earth is about 7,918 miles or 12,742 km in diameter. It is a terrestrial planet with a solid surface, a central core of liquid iron, and a multitude of geological features, such as mountains and valleys, as well as oceans.
                
                2. Atmosphere: Earth's atmosphere is made up of about 78 percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen, with trace amounts of other gases like carbon dioxide and argon. The atmosphere is an essential element that shelters the life-giving forms on the planet from the damaging solar radiations.
                
                3. **Water**: Water comprises about 71% of the Earth's surface area, largely through oceans. Freshwater exists in rivers, lakes, and ice caps and glaciers, and it constitutes a relatively small proportion of the entire planet.
                
                4. **Life**: Earth is home to around 8.7 million plant, animal, fungi, and microorganism species. This is the reason why it is termed a biodiversity hotspot. Life on earth occurs from the lowest depths in the deep oceans to the high mountain ranges.
                
                5. **Climate**: Earth's climate ranges from the hottest-hot deserts to a nearly perpetual frost in Arctic regions. Many factors exist that modify the earth climate, including latitude, altitude, and proximity to oceans, leading to a vast array of ecosystems.
                
                6. Natural Resources: Earth is very well supplied with natural resources-natural minerals, fossil fuels, and forests. Natural resource management is crucial to the health of our planet and its human subjects.
                
                7. Human Impact: Certainly, human interference in industrialization, deforestation, and pollution has marred the environment of Earth to a great extent. Climate change, loss of biodiversity, and habitat destruction are some of the major challenges that face the planet today.
                
                8. **Exploration**: So far, Earth has been studied exhaustively with the help of satellite imagery, scientific research, and exploration. It has established a new understanding of its systems, for instance, weather patterns, geological processes, and ecosystems.
                
                Earth remains so unique and precious a planet with investment to protect and preserve environmental efforts for the future.</p>

            <h1 class="text-center text-danger">Venus</h1>
            <p class="text-white">Venus is the second-closest to the Sun in our solar system, often referred to as Earth's "sister planet" due to size and composition. Here are the following key facts about Venus:

                1. **Size and Composition**: With a diameter of around 7,521 miles (12,104 kilometers), Venus is roughly almost the same size as Earth. Composition is largely rocky with a metallic core and a silicate mantle.
                
                2. **Atmosphere**: Venus has an extremely dense atmosphere, mostly carbon dioxide and nitrogen with some clouds of sulfuric acid. A runaway greenhouse effect causes average surface temperatures to be about 900 degrees Fahrenheit on Venus, making Venus the hottest planet in our solar system.
                
                3. **Surface Features**: Venus surface features include large plains, some highlands, and many volcanoes. No liquid water bodies are present there but shows signs of active volcanism might be preserved.
                
                4. **Rotation and Orbit**: Venus is also very slow in rotation on the axis, which is about 243 Earth days to complete one turn. Curiously, Venus rotates in the opposite direction of most planets, so that here, the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east; orbital period around the Sun is approximately 225 Earth days.
                
                5. **Waterless**: Venus does not have a significant amount of waters. Any that once existed probably got evaporated due to high heat and pressure levels of Venus.
                
                6. **Explored**: During the course of time, several spacecraft have explored Venus, one such is NASA's Magellan and Soviet Union's Venera missions, which have provided with a wealth of information regarding its atmosphere, surface, and geological features.
                
                7. **Volcanic Activity**: More significant proof of strong volcanic activities in Venus can be indicated by numerous giant volcanoes and vast lava plains. Other scientists think Venus is still geologically active.
                8. **Climate**: An extreme greenhouse effect that has made the atmospheric pressure on Venus reach 92 times higher than on Earth, leaving Venus's environment inhospitable for life like it exists today.
                
                Venus is an interesting topic to pursue research in atmospheric science and climate studies, as scientists can gain insight into the impacts of greenhouse gases and climate change.</p>

            <p class="text-white">
                Mercury is the closest to the Sun and also the smallest planet of our solar system. The following are some of the most important facts regarding the planet of Mercury:

1. **Size and Composition**: The diameter of the planet is approximately 3,032 miles, slightly larger than the Earth's Moon in size. It is a rocky planet with a metallic core and a silicate mantle.

2. **Surface Features**: Mercury's surface is highly cratered and very similar to the moon. It has enormous cliffs, often called "lobate scarps," that formed as the planet cooled and shrunk with time.

3. **Temperature Extremes**: Temperatures on Mercury vary between extremes. During the day, they can reach to about 800 degrees Fahrenheit or 427 degrees Celsius, and at night they reach as low as about -330 degrees Fahrenheit or -201 degrees Celsius. This is because Mercury has a very thin atmosphere, which could not retain heat.

4. **Orbit and Rotation**: The Mercury orbits around the Sun with its orbit being eccentric that it is elliptical, it takes around one earth day to complete nearly 88. It takes nearly 59 Earth days for the planet to rotate completely on its axis resulting in a reversed or different pattern of the day-night cycle. Here, one day (sunrise to sunrise) takes nearly 176 Earth days.

5. **Atmosphere**: Mercury's atmosphere is extremely thin and mostly composed of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. There is no substantial protection offered against solar radiation or temperature fluctuations by this superficial atmosphere.

6. **Magnetic Field**: Mercury has a very weak magnetic field, about 1 percent as intense as that of Earth. This weak magnetic field is considered to be caused by Mercury's liquid outer core.

7. **Exploration**: Mercury has been visited by two spacecraft: NASA's Mariner 10, which in the 1970s flew by, and more recently, the MESSENGER spacecraft that orbited Mercury from 2011 to 2015, providing detailed information about its geology, surface composition, and history.
8. **Water Ice**: Interesting fact: There are permanently shadowed craters near Mercury's poles, containing water ice. Since the sun barely reaches these areas, this ice never melts.

Mercury remains of interest today because there is an extreme case of conditions on the planet and its characteristics that allow scientists to derive ideas regarding the formation and evolution of a planet.
